    "For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing; that is, programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what you want.\n",
    "The idea is that you should start with a working program and make small modifications, debugging them as you go.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find yourself spending a lot of time debugging, that is often a sign that you are writing too much code before you start tests.\n",
