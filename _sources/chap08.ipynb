      "If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you.\"\n",

      "\"Send the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomes\n",
      "conscious, after the operation.\" So I said:--\n",
      "\"I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can at\n",
      "present. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate.\n",
      "Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.\"\n",
      "The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.\n",
      "The wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressed\n",
      "Professor thought a moment and said:--\n",
      "\"We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far\n",
      "too late.\" As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I\n",
      "went over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and\n",
      "Quincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:--\n",
      "\"I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.\n",
      "So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things\n",

      "The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a\n",
      "horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing's face I gathered\n",
      "the words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think;\n",
      "At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was\n",
      "sinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor\n",
      "\"There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I have\n",
      "We shall operate just above the ear.\"\n",
      "Without another word he made the operation. For a few moments the\n",
      "Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare.\n",
      "This was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad\n",
      "\"I'll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. I\n",
      "dreadfully.\" He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his\n",
      "eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van\n",
      "Helsing said in a quiet grave tone:--\n",

      "\"That is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me some\n",
      "stopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey--\"The\n",

      "\"Quick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes;\n",
      "and then I must go back to death--or worse! Wet my lips with brandy\n",

      "Helsing's eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and\n",
      "and said: \"Go on,\" in a low voice. Renfield proceeded:--\n",
      "\"He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before;\n",
      "Then he began promising me things--not in words but by doing them.\" He\n",
      "was interrupted by a word from the Professor:--\n",
      "\"How?\"\n",
      "\"By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the\n",

      "then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there\n",
      "were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like His, only\n",
      "seemed to be saying: 'All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more\n",
      "me!' And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close\n",
      "the sash and saying to Him: 'Come in, Lord and Master!' The rats were\n",
      "all gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only\n",
      "open an inch wide--just as the Moon herself has often come in through\n",
      "His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and\n",
      "back to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: \"Let him go on. Do\n",
      "if once he lost the thread of his thought.\" He proceeded:--\n",
      "\"All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not\n",

      "\"When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn't the same;\n",
      "it was like tea after the teapot had been watered.\" Here we all moved,\n",
      "to know that He had been taking the life out of her.\" I could feel that\n",
      "the rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. \"So when\n",
      "He came to-night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and I\n",
      "Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle\n",

      "\"We know the worst now,\" he said. \"He is here, and we know his purpose.\n",

      "He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield. We threw\n",
      "headlong into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I saw\n",
      "The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room\n",
      "was light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan\n",
      "Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.\n",
      "Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad\n",
      "His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised\n",
      "the Count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left\n",
      "hand he held both Mrs. Harker's hands, keeping them away with her arms\n",
      "compel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his\n",
      "and sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet,\n",
      "and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred\n",
      "Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside\n",
      "under Quincey's match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we\n",
      "open, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved\n",
      "forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with\n",
      "Count's terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail\n",
      "endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently\n",
      "over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant\n",
      "despairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:--\n",
      "\"Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce. We can\n",
      "do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers\n",
      "herself; I must wake him!\" He dipped the end of a towel in cold water\n",

      "Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great\n",
      "instant I heard Harker's quick exclamation as he woke to partial\n",
      "\"In God's name what does this mean?\" Harker cried out. \"Dr. Seward, Dr.\n",
      "Van Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear,\n",
      "what is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come to\n",
      "together. \"Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!\" With a quick\n",
      "man in him awake at the need for instant exertion. \"What has happened?\n",
      "Tell me all about it!\" he cried without pausing. \"Dr. Van Helsing, you\n",
      "love Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too\n",
      "far yet. Guard her while I look for _him_!\" His wife, through her terror\n",
      "\"No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enough\n",
      "to-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You must stay\n",
      "with me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!\" Her\n",
      "Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up his\n",
      "\"Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you no\n",
      "and take counsel together.\" She shuddered and was silent, holding down\n",
      "\"Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that it\n",
      "most cause to fear.\" To this he spoke out resolutely:--\n",
      "\"Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word. I would not\n",
      "hear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by my\n",

      "\"And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broad\n",
      "and his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had\n",
      "hair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.\n",
      "They entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at me\n",
      "to him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming\n",
      "however----\" He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on\n",
      "the bed. Van Helsing said gravely:--\n",
      "\"Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our hope now\n",
      "is in knowing all. Tell freely!\" So Art went on:--\n",
      "\"He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few\n",
      "had helped the flames.\" Here I interrupted. \"Thank God there is the\n",
      "other copy in the safe!\" His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he\n",
      "into Renfield's room; but there was no trace there except----!\" Again he\n",
      "paused. \"Go on,\" said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head and\n",

      "\"God's will be done!\" I could not but feel that Art was keeping back\n",

      "\"And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?\"\n",
      "\"A little,\" he answered. \"It may be much eventually, but at present I\n",
      "can't say. I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would\n",
