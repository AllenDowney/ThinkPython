# Think Python, 3rd edition

*Think Python* is an introduction to Python for people who have never programmed before -- or for people who have tried and had a hard time.

[Here is the landing page for the book at Green Tea Press](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-3rd-edition/).

For the third edition, the biggest changes are:

* The book is now entirely in Jupyter notebooks, so you can read the text, run the code, and work on the exercises. Using the links below, you can run the notebooks on Colab, so you don't have to install anything to get started.

* The text is substantially revised and a few chapters have been reordered. There are more exercises now, and I think a lot of them are better.

* At the end of every chapter, there are suggestions for using tools like ChatGPT and Colab AI to learn more and to help with the exercises.

The book is scheduled to be published by O'Reilly Media in July 2024, so it is a work in progress.
Starting in January 2024, I plan to release new chapters here, about one per week.
